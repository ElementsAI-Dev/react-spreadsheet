- **[Core Data Structures Overview](overview/core-data-structures-overview.md)** - Immutable 2D grid data structures and coordinate systems

## Architecture Documents

LLM retrieval maps for understanding how the system is built.

### Component System Architecture

- **[Component Layer](architecture/component-layer.md)** - React UI components structure and relationships
- **[Spreadsheet Component Orchestration](architecture/component-spreadsheet-orchestration.md)** - Main Spreadsheet component that manages all state, context, and event handling
- **[Component Hierarchy and Enhancement Pattern](architecture/component-hierarchy-and-enhancement.md)** - Tree structure of components and the HOC pattern that injects state

### State Management Architecture

- **[State Management](architecture/state-management.md)** - Redux-style reducer pattern with React Context
- **[StoreState and Action Types](architecture/state-store-and-actions.md)** - Complete state shape definition and all 20 action types
- **[State Context and Selectors](architecture/state-context-and-hooks.md)** - React Context implementation with use-context-selector and custom hooks

### Formula Engine Architecture

- **[Engine Layer](architecture/engine-layer.md)** - Formula evaluation engine with dependency tracking and circular reference detection
- **[Formula Dependency Graph](architecture/formula-dependency-graph.md)** - Immutable directed graph tracking cell-to-cell dependencies
- **[Formula Evaluation Flow](architecture/formula-evaluation-flow.md)** - End-to-end formula processing pipeline from input to computed result

### Core Data Structures Architecture

- **[Core Data Structures](architecture/core-data-structures.md)** - Immutable data structures for spreadsheet data, coordinates, ranges, and selection
- **[Matrix Operations](architecture/matrix-operations.md)** - Immutable 2D array implementation for sparse cell storage
- **[Selection and Coordinates](architecture/selection-and-coordinates.md)** - Polymorphic selection system with coordinate primitives

## Guide Documents

Step-by-step operational instructions for common development tasks.

### Development Workflow

- **[Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md)** - Common commands and development practices
- **[Testing Guide](guides/testing-guide.md)** - How to run and write tests

### How-To Guides

- **[How to Customize Components](guides/how-to-customize-components.md)** - Override default components and create custom DataViewer/DataEditor
- **[How to Use State Selectors](guides/how-to-use-state-selectors.md)** - Efficient state consumption patterns that minimize re-renders
- **[How to Use Selections](guides/how-to-use-selections.md)** - Selection type usage patterns
- **[How to Enable Virtualization](guides/how-to-enable-virtualization.md)** - Configure virtualization for large datasets

## Reference Documents

Factual, transcribed lookup information.

- **[Public API](reference/public-api.md)** - Exported components, types, and utilities
- **[Type Definitions](reference/type-definitions.md)** - Core TypeScript type definitions
- **[Coding Conventions](reference/coding-conventions.md)** - TypeScript, ESLint, testing, and code style standards
- **[Git Conventions](reference/git-conventions.md)** - Branch strategy and commit message formats

## Scout Reports (Temporary)

These investigation reports in `llmdoc/agent/` were generated by Scout agents and can be deleted after final documentation is complete.

- `claude-md-investigation.md` - Investigation of Claude.md file structure
- `scout-core-report.md` - Core data structures investigation
- `scout-state-report.md` - State management investigation
- `scout-engine-report.md` - Formula engine investigation
- `scout-components-report.md` - Component system investigation
- `scout-build-report.md` - Build system investigation

## Documentation Navigation Strategy

For LLM agents working on this codebase:

1. **First-time orientation:** Start with [Project Overview](overview/project-overview.md), then read relevant overview documents
2. **Feature development:** Read related architecture documents to understand the implementation
3. **Bug fixing:** Use guide documents for step-by-step procedures
4. **API usage:** Reference documents provide quick lookup information
